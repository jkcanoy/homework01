# Adding Semantic Elements to HTML

## Description
   
    Semantic elements to HTML reinforces the _meaning_ of the content. 
   A tag such as <div> does not tell us anything about the content, whereas tags lik <header>, <footer>, and <nav> tell us exactly what the content between the tags is going to be. 
   Semantic tags provide additional information about the document, making it clear to the browser what is actually going on on the page. 
    
    Semantic elements are important for _Search Engine Optimization_. 
  A search engine will easier recognize the name of the webpage if it is put within an important <header> tag instead of having it lost in the unimportant <div> tags, allowing for better ranking in the search engine results.
    
    Semantic elements are also important for _accessibility_. 
  By making sure the content is apporpriately markedup, screen readers or other assistive devices can then accurately convey what is on the webpage to users. 
  An image with an appropriate alt attribute can be conveyed by a screen reader instead of skipped over. 
  A screen reader set up to read only headers or links will be able to do so if a webpage contains semantic markup.
